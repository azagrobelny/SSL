PEM Format
##########
The certificate file types can be .pem, .crt, .cer, or .key. The .pem file can include the server certificate, the
certificate and the private key in a single file. The server certificate and intermediate certificate can also be in a
separate .crt or .cer file. The private key can be in a .key file.
PEM files use ASCII encoding, so you can open them in any text editor such as notepad, MS word etc. Each certificate
the PEM file is contained between the ---- BEGIN CERTIFICATE---- and ----END CERTIFICATE---- statements. The private
key is contained between the ---- BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY----- and -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY----- statements. The CSR is
contained between the -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE REQUEST----- and -----END CERTIFICATE REQUEST----- statements. 

Convert PEM to PFX
openssl pkcs12 -export -out certificate.pfx -inkey privateKey.key -in certificate.crt -certfile more.crt
Convert PEM to PKCS#12
openssl pkcs12 -export -out certificate.pfx -inkey privateKey.key -in certificate.crt -certfile CACert.crt
Convert PEM to DER
openssl x509 -outform der -in certificate.pem -out certificate.der
Convert PEM to CER
openssl x509 -outform der -in certificate.pem -out certificate.crt
Convert PEM to P7B
openssl crl2pkcs7 -nocrl -certfile certificate.cer -out certificate.p7b -certfile CACert.cer
Convert CRT to DER
openssl x509 -outform der -in rootCA.crt -out rootCA.der

PKCS#7 Format
#############
The PKCS#7 format is a Cryptographic Message Syntax Standard. The PKCS#7 certificate uses Base64 ASCII encoding
file extension .p7b or .p7c. Only certificates can be stored in this format, not private keys. The P7B certificates are
contained between the "-----BEGIN PKCS7-----" and "-----END PKCS7-----" statements.
Convert P7B to PEM
openssl pkcs7 -print_certs -in certificate.p7b -out certificate.cer
Convert P7B to PFX
openssl pkcs7 -print_certs -in certificate.p7b -out certificate.cer
openssl pkcs12 -export -in certificate.cer -inkey privateKey.key -out certificate.pfx -certfile CACert.cer

DER Format
############
The DER certificates are in binary form, contained in .der or .cer files. These certificates are mainly used in Javaweb servers.
Convert DER to PEM
openssl x509 -inform der -in certificate.cer -out certificate.pem

PKCS#12 Format
##############
The PKCS#12 certificates are in binary form, contained in .pfx or .p12 files.
The PKCS#12 can store the server certificate, the intermediate certificate and the private key in a single .pfx file with
password protection. These certificates are mainly used on the Windows platform.
CAs provide certificates in any of the above formats. Learn how to install a certificate on different web servers in the
next chapter.
Convert PFX to PEM
openssl pkcs12 -in certificate.pfx -out cert.pem
